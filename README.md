# EPOCH//REIGN V2

Welcome to the mythic arc of **EPOCH//REIGN V2**—a lore-rich smart contract deployment built for Base, forged in ritual, and gated for collectors.

## 🔮 Lore

In the shadow of the Stone Garden, Medusa Unchained awakens. This contract is the key to her dominion—each mint a shard of her reign, each collector a vessel of her myth.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Hardhat** for contract deployment  
- **Node.js** + **npm** for scripting and automation  
- **Base** as the L2 chain of choice  
- **MIT License** for open-source clarity

## 🧙 Collector Gating

Only verified collectors may interact with the minting ritual. Gating logic is embedded in the contract and enforced at runtime.
